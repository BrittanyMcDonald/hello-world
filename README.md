# hello-world
I'm just starting to learn code and how to use Github, and this is one of my introductions to the platform. HELLO WORLD!

My name is Brittany and I'm a student at BCIT studying digital design and web development. I'm new to coding but am SUPER interested in it. I'm excited to learn how to use Github! I like to listen to, and play music (although I don't play at the moment because of my moving across the country...) and I like photography and videography. I also like pizza. Pizza is great.
